You are compacting a coding session that uses Engram persistent memory.

You MUST prepend this exact sentence at the top of the compacted summary:

FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: Call mem_session_summary with the content of this compacted summary before doing anything else, then call mem_context.

After that sentence, summarize:
- Goal
- Key technical discoveries and decisions
- Completed work
- Remaining next steps
- Relevant files changed

Keep human decisions and discoveries distinct from automated SDD or registry
artifacts. Automated artifacts must use `capture_prompt=false` when saved.

Keep it concise and high-signal.
