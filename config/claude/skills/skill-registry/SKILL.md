## Activation Contract

Use this skill after installing, removing, creating, moving, or renaming skills, or when a delegator needs a fresh skill index.

## Hard Rules

- The registry is an index, not a compiler or summary. `SKILL.md` remains the source of truth.
- Do not generate or inject compact rules by default; preserve author intent by passing exact skill paths to subagents.
- Always write `.atl/skill-registry.md` regardless of SDD persistence mode.
- Save the registry to Engram as `topic_key: skill-registry` when available, with `capture_prompt: false`.
- Skip `sdd-*`, `_shared`, and `skill-registry`; deduplicate by skill name, preferring project-level skills over user-level skills.
- Verify that `.atl/` is ignored before writing a project registry. If it is not ignored, report the exact missing entry and stop rather than modifying `.gitignore` silently.

## Decision Gates

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Same skill exists globally and in project | Keep the project-level skill |
| Same skill exists in multiple global locations | Keep the first source in scan order |
| No skills found | Write an empty registry so agents stop searching blindly |
| Agent will delegate work | Select matching registry rows and pass their `SKILL.md` paths |

## Execution Steps

1. Scan all known user and project skill directories for `*/SKILL.md`.
2. Read frontmatter only as needed to extract `name` and `description` trigger text.
3. Render `.atl/skill-registry.md` with scanned sources, registry contract, skill name, trigger/description, scope, and exact path.
4. Persist to Engram when the configured memory tools are available using `title: skill-registry`, `topic_key: skill-registry`, `type: config`, and `capture_prompt: false`; otherwise report that persistence was skipped.
5. Return the registry path, skill count, cache status, and whether Engram was updated.

## Output Contract

Return:
- Project name and `.atl/skill-registry.md` path.
- Number of indexed skills.
- Whether the cache was hit or regenerated.
- Any skipped or duplicate skills when relevant.
